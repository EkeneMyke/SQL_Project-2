#DANNY'S FOODIE-FI
Subscription based businesses are super popular and Danny realised that there
was a large gap in the market - he wanted to create a new streaming service that
only had food related content - something like Netflix but with only
cooking shows!

Danny finds a few smart friends to launch his new startup Foodie-Fi in 2020 and
started selling monthly and annual subscriptions, giving their customers
unlimited on-demand access to exclusive food videos from around the world!

Danny created Foodie-Fi with a data driven mindset and wanted to ensure all
future investment decisions and new features were decided using data.
